Making a release for CDM/TDS with jenkins
last edited 08/26/2014

1. Jenkins
  - Go to Jenkin project's configuration page
      - Under "Source Code Management" - "Additional Behaviors" - Add - "Check out to specific local branch"
      - Enter the branch name for the next version, eg if current is "4.5.3", then use "4.5.4" here
      - "Save" the changes
  - Click on "Perform maven release"
      - Click on "Schedule Maven Release Build"
  - Build is done
      - Check logs for success (or any problems)
      - If the local branch was not specified, you will get the following error
        "Detecting the current branch failed: fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref"

2. Check that all went well:
    - gitHub has new release tag, eg "v{release}"
    - gitHub has new branch, eg if current is "4.5.3", then "4.5.4" should now be on gitHub
    - Check release artifacts are in artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu, eg http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/

3. Jenkins- "Additional Behaviors"
   -  Go back to the CMD/TDS project's configuration page, "Source Code Management"
    - Update "Branches to build" to new branch, eg "target-{next}"
    - Delete "Checkout to local branch" (added in the first step of "1. Jenkins")
    - Check "Branches to build" now refers to the new one
    - Save

4. Git (ONLY IF THIS IS STABLE RELEASE)
  - go to github thredds repo, "settings"
  - change "Default branch" to the released version

5. put thredds.war on conan ftp  (best to do from ssh)
  - cd /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{version}
  - mkdir {release}
  - from http://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/tds/{release}/
     download tds-{release}.war tds-{release}.war.md5 tds-{release}.sha1 to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{version}/{release}
     rename to thredds.war, thredds.war.md5 and thredds.war.sha1
  - move /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{version}/current to point to /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{version}/{release}
     rm current
     ln -s {release} current

6. build cdm locally
    git fetch
    git checkout "v{release}"
    cd {github/thredds}
    mvn clean install

7a. put ncIdv onto conan ftp
   cd  /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{version}
   wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/ncIdv/4.3.23/ncIdv-4.3.23.jar

7. put ncIdv, netcdfAll, toolsUI onto conan ftp
    cp {github/thredds}/ncIdv/target/ncIdv-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{version}        (could do it this way instead of 7a)
    cp {github/thredds}/ui/target/netcdfAll-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{version}
    cp {github/thredds}/ui/target/toolsUI-{release}.jar to /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/v{version}

    (from ssh)
    cd /web/ftp/pub/netcdf-java/{version}
    rm toolsUI-{version}.jar netcdfAll-{version}.jar ncIdv-{version}.jar
    ln -s toolsUI-{release}.jar toolsUI-{version}.jar
    ln -s netcdfAll-{release}.jar netcdfAll-{version}.jar
    ln -s ncIdv-{release}.jar ncIdv-{version}.jar

8. put tdm onto conan ftp (version 4.5 and above)
    cp {github/thredds}/tdm/build/tdm-{release}.jar /web/ftp/pub/thredds/{version}/current/tdm-{version}.jar

9. CDM has additional targets that are handled by gradle builds
  - modify build.gradle in top directory to use the correct version
  - make sure you have correct gradle.properties in ~home/.gradle/  [See John or Sean for info]
  - cd {github/thredds}
  a. make supporting libraries
      gradle clean build -x test
      If this fails but mvn works, make sure that any new dependencies added to the project modules were
      also added to the build.gradle files.
  b. release webstart to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v{version}/webstart
      gradle -p ui releaseWebstart
  c. release cdm javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v{version}/javadoc
      gradle -p cdm releaseDocs
  d. release all javadocs to conan:/content/software/netcdf-java/v{version}/javadocAll
      gradle -p ui releaseDocs

10. update Unidata download page(s)
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/thredds/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/thredds/toc.xml as needed
  - check http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/index.jsp
    modify conan:/content/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-java-4/toc.xml as needed

11. if you need to do any changes to web pages, do it on the next branch (eg target-{next})

12. To start working with the next branch in IntelliJ
  - Git Fetch
  - Checkout <new branch>

=========================

Configuration files

- kept in git repo thredds/TdsConfig

- each machine has their own subdirectory:
  - idd : common to all idd servers
  - rdavm : at CISL/DSS
  - remotetest : opendap/netcdf C test server
  - thredds : mlode
  - threddsDev : lead (both test and dev at this point)

- to build the config:
   ./build.py [remotetest thredds]

   This will build config.zip files (and wget scripts) for all of the subdirectories.
   You can optionally pass one or more subdirectories to only build for them.
   This script runs on Python 2.7 as well as >= 3.2.
   Note <subdir>/build.info is used for this script.

- to make changes to config files:
 - edit thredds/TdsConfig/*
 - run build.py
 - copy and unzip config.zip to (root)/content/thredds, or use the fetch.sh (wget) that is also generated, from the client


==========================
REVIEW  IN PROCESS

Building with gradle (4.4+)

1. checkout from git

2. configure gradle

add a file gradle.properties to $userHome/.gradle  directory, with these properties:

  keystore=/share/idv/.keystore-2012
  keystoreAlias=<alias>
  keystorePassword=<password>
  webdir=W:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/
  ftpdir=V:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

where:

 first 3 are for signing jars
 next 2 are locations for releasing cdm jars
 (the values can all be fake until you get to step 4, but keys must be defined)

3. build from command line. this will download current gradle, skipping tests:

    gradlew clean build -x test

   to run tests:

    gradlew test --continue

   optional libraries using shadow:

     gradlew shadow -p cdm (build cdms.jar)
     gradlew shadow -p ncIdv (build ncIdvs.jar)
     gradlew shadow -p ui (build toolsUI.jar)

4. build from intellij (problems with 12.1, apparently will be improved in v13)

4.1 upgrade intellij Project

  File > Settings
  Gradle

  - enter $thredds/build.gradle into box
  - accept all the defaults

  A JetGradle left side tab will now appear

4.2 new intellij project

  1) File > Import Project

    - navigate entry box to $thredds/build.gradle
    - accept all the defaults
    - a .idea directory is added under $thredds

  2) add git root to project

     File > Settings
     Version Control - add $thredds to git root


--------------------------
08/05/2013

1) install gradle

Download latest gradle from gradle.org. Currently at 1.7-rc-2
Unzip into your chosen directory.
Add env variable GRADLE_HOME = gradle top directory
Add GRADLE_HOME/bin directory to your path
test from command line: "gradle -version"

2) configure gradle

add a file gradle.properties to $userHome/.gradle  directory, with these properties:

  keystore=/share/idv/.keystore-2012
  keystoreAlias=<alias>
  keystorePassword=<password>
  webdir=W:/content/software/netcdf-java/v4.3/
  ftpdir=V:/pub/netcdf-java/v4.3

where:

first 3 are for signing jars
next 2 are locations for releasing cdm jars
(the values can all be fake until you get to step 4, but keys must be defined)

3) building

cd $THREDDS
gradle clean install -x test

first time, you will see gradle pull down maven artifacts into its repository in $userHome/.gradle/cache

3) release
